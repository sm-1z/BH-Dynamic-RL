## BH-Dynamic-RL

This repository is designed to run BH-Dynamic models in both single-objective and multi-objective reinforcement learning environments.

In a single-objective environment, [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) and [Stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) are called.

In a multi-objective environment, [MO-Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/mo-gymnasium) and [MORL-Baselines](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/morl-baselines) are called.

## Structure

The repository's structure is as follows:

`SORL/`contains files in a single-objective environment

`MORL/`contains files in a multi-objective environment

`Require/`contains files used in BH_Dyn model

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the `README.md` in each directory
